We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to install and use the App for personal finance management.
You may not copy, modify, reverse engineer, or resell the App except as permitted by law.
Do not misuse the App, interfere with its operation, or use it to transmit unlawful, harmful, or misleading content.

You grant us a limited license to process this data solely to operate the App, provide AI insights, offer customer support, and comply with legal obligations.
You are responsible for the accuracy and legality of the content you submit and for maintaining backups if needed.

5. AI Features and Insights

They do not constitute financial, investment, tax, accounting, legal, medical, or other professional advice.
Always verify AI outputs before acting and consult a qualified professional when appropriate.
We are not liable for decisions made based on AI-generated suggestions.

The App does not include advertising or data selling.
If paid features or subscriptions are offered, pricing and terms will be shown within the App.
By enrolling, you authorize applicable recurring charges.
You are responsible for any applicable taxes or fees.

7. Third-Party Services

The App may rely on third-party services such as AI processing or cloud infrastructure providers.
These services are subject to their own terms where applicable; however, we remain responsible for providing the App to you.

You may stop using the App at any time.
We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or misuse the App.
Upon termination, your license ends and you should delete the App. You may export your data beforehand if available.

The App is provided “as is” and “as available.”
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim implied warranties and limit our total liability to the amount you paid for the App in the previous 12 months, if any.
Nothing in these Terms excludes liability that cannot be excluded by law.
