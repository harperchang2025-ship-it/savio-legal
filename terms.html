<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
These Terms of Use govern your use of our personal finance and expense tracking app (the “App”). By 
installing or using the App, you agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>Eligibility and Account</h2>
<p>
You must be at least 16 years old or the age of majority in your region to use the App.
You are responsible for keeping your device secure and for ensuring that any contact or account 
information you provide is accurate.
</p>

<h2>License and Acceptable Use</h2>
<p>
We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to install and use the App 
for personal finance management.
You may not copy, modify, reverse engineer, or resell the App except as permitted by law.
Do not misuse the App, interfere with its operation, or use it to transmit unlawful, harmful, or 
misleading content.
</p>

<h2>Your Data and Rights</h2>
<p>
You own the expense data, budgets, saving goals, and other content you enter.
You grant us a limited license to process this data solely to operate the App, provide AI insights, offer 
customer support, and comply with legal obligations.
You are responsible for the accuracy and legality of the content you submit and for maintaining 
backups if needed.
</p>

<h2>AI Features and Insights</h2>
<p>
AI-generated outputs are provided for informational purposes only.
They do not constitute financial, investment, tax, accounting, legal, medical, or other professional 
advice.
Always verify AI outputs before acting and consult a qualified professional when appropriate.
We are not liable for decisions made based on AI-generated suggestions.
</p>

<h2>Payments</h2>
<p>
The App does not include advertising or data selling.
If paid features or subscriptions are offered, pricing and terms will be shown within the App.
By enrolling, you authorize applicable recurring charges.
You are responsible for any applicable taxes or fees.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The App may rely on third-party services such as AI processing or cloud infrastructure providers.
These services are subject to their own terms where applicable; however, we remain responsible for 
providing the App to you.
</p>

<h2>Termination</h2>
<p>
You may stop using the App at any time.
We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or misuse the App.
Upon termination, your license ends and you should delete the App. You may export your data 
beforehand if available.
</p>

<h2>Disclaimers and Liability</h2>
<p>
The App is provided “as is” and “as available.”
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim implied warranties and limit our total liability to 
the amount you paid for the App in the previous 12 months, if any.
Nothing in these Terms excludes liability that cannot be excluded by law.
</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>
<p>
These Terms are governed by the laws of your country or region of residence, unless mandatory 
consumer protection laws require otherwise.
Disputes will be handled by the competent courts of that jurisdiction.
</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>
We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes indicates 
acceptance of the updated Terms.
