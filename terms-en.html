      <h1>Savio Terms of Use</h1>
      <div class="meta">Last updated: December 2025</div>
    
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms of Use govern your use of Savio (the “App”). By installing or using the App, you agree to these Terms
        and to our Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h3>Eligibility</h3>
      <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the age required in your region) to use the App.</p>

      <h3>License</h3>
      <p>
        We grant you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to use the App for personal finance management.
        You may not copy, modify, reverse engineer, or resell the App except as permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h3>Acceptable use</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not misuse the App or interfere with its operation.</li>
        <li>Do not attempt to access systems or data you are not authorized to access.</li>
        <li>Do not upload unlawful, harmful, or misleading content.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Your data</h3>
      <p>
        You own the expense, budget, and goal data you enter. You grant us a limited license to process that data solely
        to operate the App, provide features you request (including AI features), provide support, and comply with law.
        You are responsible for the accuracy of your entries and for maintaining backups if you need them.
      </p>

      <h3>AI features and outputs</h3>
      <p class="note">
        AI outputs are automatically generated suggestions for informational purposes only. They are not financial, investment, tax,
        accounting, legal, medical, or other professional advice. Verify outputs before acting and consult a professional when needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI results may be inaccurate. Please review and confirm all parsed records and suggestions before saving or taking action.
      </p>

      <h3>Subscriptions / In-App Purchases (if offered)</h3>
      <p>
        If the App offers paid features, subscriptions, or in-app purchases, pricing and terms will be shown in the App.
        Payments are processed by Apple via your Apple ID. We do not receive your full payment card details.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
        <li>You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings.</li>
        <li>Refund requests are handled by Apple under Apple’s policies, unless required otherwise by law.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Third-party services</h3>
      <p>
        The App may rely on third-party services (e.g., cloud hosting, AI processing) to function. Use of those services may be subject
        to their terms as applicable; we remain responsible for providing the App to you under these Terms.
      </p>

      <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>
        The App is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the maximum extent allowed by law, we disclaim implied warranties.
      </p>

      <h3>Limitation of liability</h3>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent allowed by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
        or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill. Our total liability for all claims is limited to the amount you paid for the App
        in the prior 12 months (if any), unless law requires a different limitation.
      </p>

      <h3>Termination</h3>
      <p>
        You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you breach these Terms or misuse the App.
      </p>

      <h3>Governing law</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of your country/region of residence, unless different rules are required by applicable consumer laws.
      </p>

      <h3>Changes</h3>
      <p>We may update these Terms and will update the “Last updated” date. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</p>
