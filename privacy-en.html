      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: December 2025</p>
    
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Savio (the “App”) is a personal finance and expense tracking app that lets you record expenses by typing or voice,
        set budgets and saving goals, and view insights. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it,
        and your choices.
      </p>

      <h3>Data you provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Expense data:</strong> entries you input (amount, category/subcategory, date/time, payment method, notes).</li>
        <li><strong>Budget and goals:</strong> monthly budget totals, category budgets, saving goals and related settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional daily factors:</strong> mood, weather, sleep (if you choose to add them).</li>
        <li><strong>Support contact info (optional):</strong> name/email/message content if you contact support.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Voice input</h3>
      <p>
        If you use voice features, your speech is converted to text (speech-to-text). We do not require you to upload or keep
        raw voice recordings to use the App. Any audio used for transcription is discarded after transcription by default.
      </p>

      <h3>Device and app data</h3>
      <p>
        We may process limited device/app information (device model, OS version, app version, language, and diagnostics)
        to operate, secure, and improve reliability. We do not use advertising identifiers for tracking, and we do not run
        third-party advertising SDKs.
      </p>

      <h3>Data we do not collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not access your contacts, calendars, photos/camera roll, SMS, or precise location.</li>
        <li>We do not automatically pull bank or card transactions.</li>
        <li>We do not sell or rent personal data, and we do not share data with data brokers for advertising.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>AI processing (Worker + AI provider)</h3>
      <p class="note">
        The App includes AI features (e.g., voice parsing, insights, chat). These AI features are optional to use.
        The core tracking features still work if you simply do not use AI actions (for example, you can keep manual entry
        and avoid “AI analyze” / “Ask AI”).
      </p>
      <p>
        When you request an AI feature, the App sends the minimum necessary <strong>text</strong> to our server-side proxy
        (Cloudflare Worker) to process your request. The Worker may forward necessary text to our AI processing provider
        to generate the requested response.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>What may be sent:</strong> the text transcript, the expense fields you are trying to create, and limited context
          such as budgets/goals and optional daily factors (mood/weather/sleep) <em>only if needed</em> for the requested AI output.</li>
        <li><strong>When it is sent:</strong> only when you trigger AI actions (e.g., press an AI analyze/chat button).</li>
        <li><strong>How it is used:</strong> solely to produce the requested output. We do not use it for advertising.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> our Worker is designed to minimize retention. Any server logs, if generated, are kept only as long
          as needed for security and debugging and are not used for marketing. (Your expense/budget data remains stored on-device by default.)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How we use data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide the App’s features: expense tracking, budgets, saving goals, reminders, and reports.</li>
        <li>Generate AI outputs when you request them (voice parsing, insights, chat responses).</li>
        <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, and improve reliability and performance.</li>
        <li>Respond to support requests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        We do not sell personal data. We share data only with service providers that process it for us (such as cloud hosting
        and AI processing) under confidentiality/data protection terms, or when required by law, or to protect rights and safety.
      </p>

      <h3>Storage and retention</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-device by default:</strong> expenses, budgets, and goals are stored locally on your device by default.</li>
        <li><strong>Edit/delete:</strong> you can edit or delete entries within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice:</strong> audio is discarded after transcription by default.</li>
        <li><strong>Export/backup (if enabled):</strong> if you choose to export or sync in the future, data is processed only for that purpose.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Your choices</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You can decline microphone access and still use manual entry.</li>
        <li>You can choose not to use AI actions and still use core tracking features.</li>
        <li>You can skip optional mood/weather/sleep inputs.</li>
        <li>Your entries may contain sensitive information. Please avoid entering unnecessary personal data (such as full name, ID number, 
            bank card number, or passwords).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        Data is encrypted in transit when sent off-device (e.g., to Worker/AI provider). Local data is protected by your device security.
        No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; please keep your device secure.
      </p>

      <h3>Children</h3>
      <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use the App.</p>

      <h3>Changes</h3>
      <p>We may update this policy and will update the “Last updated” date. Material changes may be notified in-app.</p>
