<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Our personal finance and expense tracking app (the “App”) lets you record expenses by typing or voice,
set budgets and saving goals, and receive AI-powered suggestions. This Privacy Policy explains what
data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.
</p>

<h2>Data We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Account or support details you provide (such as name or email)</li>
  <li>Expense entries, budgets, saving goals, and notes you input</li>
  <li>Voice input is transcribed to text; audio recordings are discarded after transcription</li>
  <li>Optional emotion, sleep, or weather factors you add to improve insights</li>
  <li>Device and app information (device model, OS version, app version, language, diagnostics) used
      to operate and secure the service</li>
</ul>
<p>
We do not collect advertising identifiers and do not use third-party analytics SDKs other than AI 
processing.
</p>

<h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Contacts, calendars, photos, camera roll, or SMS</li>
  <li>Precise location data</li>
  <li>Bank or card transactions (we do not automatically pull financial data)</li>
  <li>Advertising or tracking data</li>
</ul>
<p>
We do not sell or rent personal data.
</p>

<h2>How We Use Data</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To provide expense tracking, budgets, saving goals, reminders, and customer support</li>
  <li>To generate AI insights and chat responses</li>
  <li>To protect the App, prevent abuse, and improve reliability</li>
</ul>

<h2>AI Processing</h2>
<p>
When you request AI insights or use AI chat, the App sends only the minimum necessary text (such as
expense details, budgets, goals, and optional emotion, sleep, or weather tags) to our AI processing
provider.
The provider uses this data solely to generate the requested response, may temporarily log it for safety
and quality purposes, and does not use it for advertising or unrelated model training.
We do not sell or share this data for marketing.
</p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>
We do not sell personal data and do not allow advertising tracking.
We share data only with service providers that process it on our behalf (such as AI processing and 
cloud hosting) under confidentiality and data protection obligations, or when required by law or to 
protect rights.
</p>

<h2>Storage and Retention</h2>
<p>
Expense, budget, and saving goal data are stored on your device by default.
You can edit or delete entries at any time and remove local data through your device settings or within 
the App.
Voice recordings are discarded after transcription.
If you choose to back up, sync, or export data, it is stored only for that purpose and for as long as 
needed.
Support messages are retained only as necessary to respond and comply with legal obligations.
</p>

<h2>User Control</h2>
<p>
You choose what data to enter.
You may decline microphone access and still use the App.
Optional emotion, sleep, or weather inputs can be skipped.
The App remains usable even if you do not use AI-related features.
You may delete local data at any time and contact us regarding your data.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
Data is encrypted in transit and protected by your device’s security mechanisms for local storage.
No method of transmission or storage is completely secure; please keep your device protected.
</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>
The App is not intended for children under the age of 16. Do not use the App if you are under the 
required age in your region.
</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be notified within the App.
