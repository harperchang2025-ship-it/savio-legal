<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Savio is a personal finance and expense tracking app that lets you record expenses
by typing or voice, set budgets and saving goals, and receive AI-powered insights.
This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.
</p>

<h2>Data We Collect</h2>
<p>
We may collect information you voluntarily provide, including expense entries,
budgets, saving goals, notes, and optional support contact details such as name or email.
Voice input is transcribed to text and audio recordings are discarded after transcription.
</p>
<p>
We also collect limited device and app information (such as device model, OS version,
app version, language, and diagnostics) to operate, secure, and improve the App.
</p>

<h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>
We do not access your contacts, calendars, photos, camera roll, SMS, or precise location.
We do not automatically pull bank or card transactions. We do not track users for advertising
and do not sell or rent personal data.
</p>

<h2>How We Use Data</h2>
<p>
Data is used to provide expense tracking, budgets, saving goals, reminders, customer support,
and AI-powered insights, as well as to protect the App and prevent abuse.
</p>

<h2>AI Processing</h2>
<p>
When you request AI insights or chat, only the minimum necessary text data is sent
to our AI processing provider to generate responses. This data is not used for advertising
or unrelated model training.
</p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>
We do not sell personal data. We share data only with service providers who process
it on our behalf under confidentiality obligations, or when required by law.
</p>

<h2>Storage and Retention</h2>
<p>
Expense, budget, and goal data are stored locally on your device by default.
You may edit or delete data at any time. Voice recordings are discarded after transcription.
</p>

<h2>User Control</h2>
<p>
You choose what data to enter. You may decline microphone access and still use the App.
You may delete your local data at any time through the App or device settings.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
Data is encrypted in transit and protected by your device security.
No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>
Savio is not intended for children under the age of 16.
</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated
within the App.
