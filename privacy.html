5. AI Processing

When you request AI insights or use AI chat, the App sends only the minimum necessary text (such as expense details, budgets, goals, and optional emotion, sleep, or weather tags) to our AI processing provider.
The provider uses this data solely to generate the requested response, may temporarily log it for safety and quality purposes, and does not use it for advertising or unrelated model training.
We do not sell or share this data for marketing.

6. Sharing

We do not sell personal data and do not allow advertising tracking.
We share data only with service providers that process it on our behalf (such as AI processing and cloud hosting) under confidentiality and data protection obligations, or when required by law or to protect rights.

7. Storage and Retention

Expense, budget, and saving goal data are stored on your device by default.
You can edit or delete entries at any time and remove local data through your device settings or within the App.
Voice recordings are discarded after transcription.
If you choose to back up, sync, or export data, it is stored only for that purpose and for as long as needed.
Support messages are retained only as necessary to respond and comply with legal obligations.

8. User Control and Consent

You choose what data to enter.
You may decline microphone access and still use the App.
Optional emotion, sleep, or weather inputs can be skipped.
The App remains usable even if you do not use AI-related features.
You may delete local data at any time and contact us regarding your data.

9. Security

Data is encrypted in transit and protected by your device’s security mechanisms for local storage.
No method of transmission or storage is completely secure; please keep your device protected.
